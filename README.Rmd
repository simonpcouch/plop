plop is a proof-of-concept ggplot2 assistant. The package's addin launches a Shiny app that does the following:

1) Given some code selection from your editor, generates bare-bones plotting boilerplate
2) Runs the plotting code
3) Makes 4 suggestions on how to improve the plot
4) Once a suggestion has been submitted, generates new plotting code
5) Iterates on steps 2-4

Once you're satisfied with the resulting code, click "Apply" to integrate the lines back into your file.

## Installation

You can install the development version of plop like so:

``` r
pak::pak("simonpcouch/plop")
